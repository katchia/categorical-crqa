# categorical-crqa
Some code for text-based crqa

This repo applies cross-recurrence quantification analysis to categorical data. Although traditionally used for continuous data (e.g., heart rate, event related potentials, eyetracking, etc), CRQA can be applied to categorical data (e.g., a particular emotional state or not, recurrence of words, etc). 

In the following code, I apply CRQA to Justin Bieber's hit song, "Baby." 

Below I illustrate a CRQA plot. The reader will note that recurrence of words are denoted in the plot by black squares. White spaces indicate the absence of recurrence. The points can be quantified and used for further analysis.
